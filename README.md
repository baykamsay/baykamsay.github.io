## My personal webpage
A webpage where I tell about myself, share my resume and my contact information. In the future I plan to add my projects and blog too.
## Design
I used a grayscale color palette to bring out minimalism on the website. Different shades of gray combined with easy to read typefaces like Crimson Pro and Open Sans allow for a warm and cozy website. The main text written in Crimson Pro with 400 weight is designed to be welcoming to visitors with thin strokes and circular letters. The dotted background symbolizes order and harmony as they are used in notebooks to help with structure. Yet unlike squared pages dotted pages are not restrictive, they are suggestive. This symbolizes the importance of openness of the mind where the order is required for productive lives however it should not be strict or closed but open to innovation.
